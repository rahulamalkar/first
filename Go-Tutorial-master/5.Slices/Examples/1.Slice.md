Slices
======

A slice is a descriptor of an array segment. It consists of a pointer to the array, the length of the segment, and its capacity (the maximum length of the segment).

Arrays have their place, but they're a bit inflexible, so you don't see them too often in Go code. Slices, though, are everywhere. They build on arrays to provide great power and convenience.

The type specification for a slice is []T, where T is the type of the elements of the slice. Unlike an array type, a slice type has no specified length.

A slice literal is declared just like an array literal, except you leave out the element count:

```
letters := []string{"a", "b", "c", "d"}

```
A slice can be created with the built-in function called make, which has the signature,

```
func make([]T, len, cap) []T

```
where T stands for the element type of the slice to be created. The make function takes a type, a length, and an optional capacity. When called, make allocates an array and returns a slice that refers to that array.

```
len(s) == 5
cap(s) == 5

```
The zero value of a slice is nil. The len and cap functions will both return 0 for a nil slice.

A slice can also be formed by "slicing" an existing slice or array. Slicing is done by specifying a half-open range with two indices separated by a colon. For example, the expression b[1:4] creates a slice including elements 1 through 3 of b (the indices of the resulting slice will be 0 through 2).

```
b := []byte{'g', 'o', 'l', 'a', 'n', 'g'}
// b[1:4] == []byte{'o', 'l', 'a'}, sharing the same storage as b

```

The start and end indices of a slice expression are optional; they default to zero and the slice's length respectively:

```
// b[:2] == []byte{'g', 'o'}
// b[2:] == []byte{'l', 'a', 'n', 'g'}
// b[:] == b

```

Make Slice
==========

```

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    s := make([]string, 3)
    s[0] = "Bugatti" 
    s[1] = "Corvette"
    s[2] = "Shelby"

    fmt.Println(s[0])
    fmt.Println(s[1])
    fmt.Println(s[2])
}

```

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Create a slice of 5 integers.
    values := make([]int, 5)

    // Assign some elements.
    values[0] = 100
    values[4] = 200

    // Loop over elements in slice and display them.
    for v := range values {
	fmt.Println(values[v])
    }
}
```

Looping on Slices
=================
```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    cars := []string{"bmw", "jaguar", "ferrari", "hummer", "dodge", "mustang"}

    for c := 0; c < len(cars); c++ {
	fmt.Println(cars[c])
    }
}
```
